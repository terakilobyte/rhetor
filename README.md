You will need the MongoDB Training AWS credentials stored in your default location (`~/.aws/...`) and you will need to set the
environmental variable `DOCKER_API_VERSION` to your Docker API version.

`docker version | grep 'API version'`
`export DOCKER_API_VERSION=<api version from previous command>`
